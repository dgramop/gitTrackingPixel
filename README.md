# GitTracking Pixel

![GitTracker LOGO](gittracker.png)

A simple image embed that can be added to github README's to track users

You _can_ start your own server running this code, but I reccomend using the existing one that I've setup - this will allow more data to be collected, and more users to be linked to themselves (interests tracking based on github tags)

The data is made public, and IP addresses are linked to identfiers.

## Features:
- Tracks user's github view history
	- Only repos with the tracking pixel installed can be and tracked
- Users can turn off the tracking pixel (in order to protect privacy)
- Stored in database
